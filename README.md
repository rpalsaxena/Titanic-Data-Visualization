# Project 6: Data Visualizations of Titanic Dataset
-------
## Summary
-------
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Here we have a dataset of 837 people. I have done analysis as well as drawn some visualizations. My main interest is to show the survival chances of people w.r.t Sex , Age, Embarkment station, Person's Category.

In the chart, you can observe the following things.

**Chart1 : Distribution of Survival Percentage vs Categorization according to ticket fare**
  
  If a person is travelling with high price ticket i.e, VIPs then their survival rate is much higher then General & Lower Class / Employees.

**Chart2 : Distribution of Survival Percentage vs Sex Ratio**
  
  It gives an insight that Females were preferred to be saved i.e, their survival rate was high.

**Chart3 : Distribution of Survival Percentage vs Sex Ratio vs Age Categorization**
  
  It gives an insight that survival of children were higher than Adults and Senior Citizens.

**Chart4 : Distribution of Survival Percentage vs Passenger Class vs Sex Ratio**
  
  It shows that Upper Class(1st) were preffered over Middle Class(2nd) & Lower Class(3rd) passenger.
 
**Chart5 : Distribution of Survival Percentage vs Embarkment Station**
  
  It shows that people who boarded from :
  
  * Cherbourg had higher probablity of survival
  * Southampton had lowest probablity of survival
