# Project 6: Data Visualizations of Titanic Dataset
-------
## Summary
-------
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Here we have a dataset of 837 people. I have done analysis as well as drawn some visualizations. My main interest is to show the survival chances of people w.r.t Sex , Age, Embarkment station, Person's Category.

In the chart, you can observe the following things.
*Chart1 : Distribution of Survival Percentage vs Categorization according to ticket fare*

1st class has more survived passengers than other two classes.
In 1st Class and 2nd Class more than 90% female survived, while 50% female survived in 3rd Class (click female button)
There are more survived female passengers than male passengers.
